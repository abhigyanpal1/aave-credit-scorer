# Analysis of Wallet Credit Scores

![Credit Score Distribution](credit_score_hist.png)

We scored **≈3,400** wallets from the sample. Here’s what we observe across 0–1000 in 100‑point bins:

- **0–100 (≈2,050 wallets):**  
  These low scores are dominated by wallets with one or more liquidation calls and little to no successful repays. Likely high‑risk or exploit‑style behavior.

- **100–200 (≈680 wallets):**  
  Mostly small borrowers who occasionally repay but still show volatile behavior.

- **200–300 (≈300 wallets):**  
  Steady depositors with few or no borrows, showing generally responsible usage.

- **300–400 (≈190 wallets):**  
  Larger deposit volumes and some borrowing, but solid repay ratios keep them above average.

- **400–500 (≈100 wallets):**  
  High‑volume users with consistent repay behavior, very few liquidations.

- **500–600 (≈50 wallets):**  
  Top‑tier reliability—large deposits, perfect or near‑perfect repay ratios, no liquidations.

- **600–700 (≈30 wallets):**  
  Exemplary users with extended, stable histories and diversified assets.

- **700–800 (≈10 wallets):**  
  Elite outliers: extremely large volumes and spotless track records.

- **800–900 (≈5 wallets):**  
  Ultra‑prime accounts, often institutional or ultra‑long‑term holders.

- **900–1000 (≈2 wallets):**  
  Ideal behavior: zero liquidations, flawless repays, and maximum diversity over the longest time frames.
